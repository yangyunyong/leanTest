/**
 * Generic RowMapper implementation that converts a row into a new instance
 * of the specified mapped target class.  The mapped target class must be a top-level class
 * and it must have a default or no-arg constructor.
 *
 * Column values are mapped based on matching the column name as obtained from result set
 * metadata to public setters for the corresponding properties.  The names are matched either
 * directly or by transforming a name separating the parts with underscores to the same name
 * using "camel" case.
 *
 * Mapping is provided for fields in the target class that are defined as any of the
 * following types: String, byte, Byte, short, Short, int, Integer, long, Long, float, Float,
 * double, Double, BigDecimal, boolean, Boolean and java.util.Date.
 *
 * To facilitate mapping between columns and fields that don't have matching names, try using column 
 * aliases in the SQL statement like "select fname as first_name from customer".
 *
 * Please note that this class is designed to provide convenience rather than high performance.
 * For best performance consider using a custom RowMapper.
